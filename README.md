## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my B.S. in Cybersecurity. I'm graduating in May 2025 and have applied for the Information Security Management graduate program.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about AI, Machine Learning, and ISO Compliance.
- ğŸ‘¯ My current favorite hobby is weightlifting. I started 3 months ago to improve my health and found I enjoy it more that I expected.
